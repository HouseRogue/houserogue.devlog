            Well i did none of the above, but i did implement a 'resource
            inventory' and it displays correctly in the ui which is nice<br />
            there is also a turn counter and a next turn button which does
            nothing but progress the turn counter and accumulate resources as of
            now.

          <p dir="auto">
            Also it is becoming increasingly obvious a some kind of a 'resource
            overview' or 'economy' pannel will be required. It can follow a
            simple formula for now.

            the road upkeep should grow as number of workers grows, a nd their
            demands grow, which in term is dictated by nearby improvements.....
